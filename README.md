# Overview

This project is a simple Kotlin-based Task Manager built to deepen my understanding of the Kotlin language and its syntax. As a software developer, my goal with this project was to explore how Kotlin handles object-oriented design, file I/O, and user interaction through command-line interfaces.

The software allows users to add new tasks, view current tasks, mark tasks as complete, delete tasks, and save the task data between sessions using file storage. This small utility helped me practice Kotlin's syntax for classes, data handling, and conditionals, while also working with file read/write operations.
